	To study natural examples of broad neutralization, we analyzed sera

	of sera neutralized more than 75\% of a panel of 20 diverse viral
	isolates. Little activity was observed in sera from long-term nonprogressors
	(elite controllers). Breadth of neutralization was correlated with
	viral load, but not with CD4 count, history of past antiretroviral
	use, age, gender, race/ethnicity, or route of exposure. Clustering
	analysis of sera by a novel method identified a statistically robust
	subgrouping of sera that demonstrated broad and potent neutralization
	activity.},

  abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) are thought to play an important role
	in prevention and control of HIV-1 infection and should be targeted
	by an AIDS vaccine. It is critical to understand how HIV-1 induces
	Nabs by analyzing viral sequences in both tested viruses and sera.
	Neutralization susceptibility to antibodies in autologous and heterologous
	plasma was determined for multiple Envs (3-6) from each of 15 subtype-C-infected
	individuals. Heterologous neutralization was divided into two distinct
	groups: plasma with strong, cross-reactive neutralization (n=9) and
	plasma with weak neutralization (n=6). Plasma with cross-reactive
	heterologous Nabs also more potently neutralized contemporaneous
	autologous viruses. Analysis of Env sequences in plasma from both
	groups revealed a three-amino-acid substitution pattern in the V4
	region that was associated with greater neutralization potency and
	breadth. Identification of such potential neutralization signatures
	may have important implications for the development of HIV-1 vaccines
	capable of inducing Nabs to subtype C HIV-1.},

  abstract = {Understanding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission
	is central to developing effective prevention strategies, including
	a vaccine. We compared phenotypic and genetic variation in HIV-1
	env genes from subjects in acute/early infection to subjects with
	chronic infections in the context of subtype C heterosexual transmission.
	We found that the transmitted viruses all used CCR5 and required
	high levels of CD4 to infect target cells, suggesting selection for
	replication in T cells after transmission and not macrophages. In
	addition, the transmitted viruses were more likely to use a maraviroc-sensitive
	conformation of CCR5, perhaps identifying a feature of the target
	T cell. We confirmed an earlier observation that the transmitted
	viruses were on average modestly under-glycosylated relative to the
	viruses from chronically infected subjects. This difference was most
	pronounced in comparing the viruses in acutely infected men to those
	in chronically infected women. These features of the transmitted
	virus point to selective pressures during the transmission event.
	We did not observe a consistent difference in heterologous neutralization
	sensitivity between the two groups, or in sensitivity to soluble
	CD4, suggesting similar conformations between viruses from acute
	and chronic infection. However, the presence or absence of glycosylation
	sites had differential effects on neutralization sensitivity for
	different antibodies. We suggest that the occasional absence of glycosylation
	sites encoded in the conserved regions of env, further reduced in
	transmitted viruses, could expose specific surface structures on
	the protein as antibody targets.},

	rather than strain-specific neutralizing activity.},

  abstract = {It is assumed that an effective human immunodeficiency virus type
	1 (HIV-1) vaccine should be capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies.
	However, even the best antibodies known to date lack neutralizing
	ability against a significant proportion of primary HIV-1 variants
	and, despite great efforts, still no immunogen is available that
	can elicit humoral immunity which is protective against infection
	or disease progression. We tested sera from 35 participants in the
	Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection, who were all infected
	with HIV-1 subtype B and therapy-na√Øve at the time of sampling, for
	neutralizing activity against a panel of 23 tier 2-3 HIV-1 variants,
	with a minimum of five HIV-1 variants per subtype (A, B, C and D).
	Strong cross-clade neutralizing activity was detected in sera from
	seven individuals. Strikingly, sera from 22 of 35 individuals (63\%)
	neutralized three or more of the six tier 2-3 HIV-1 subtype B viruses
	in the panel. There was a strong correlation between neutralization
	titre and breadth in serum. Indeed, the IC(50) of sera with strong
	cross-clade neutralizing activity was significantly higher than the
	IC(50) of sera with cross-subtype B activity, which, in turn, had
	a higher IC(50) than sera with the lowest neutralization breadth.
	These results imply that humoral immunity, at least in HIV-1 subtype
	B-infected individuals, is often subtype-specific rather than strain-specific
	and that the breadth of neutralization is correlated with the titre
	of neutralizing activity in serum. Considering the difficulties in
	designing a vaccine that is capable of eliciting cross-clade neutralizing
	activity, subtype-specific vaccines may be explored as an interesting
	alternative.},
