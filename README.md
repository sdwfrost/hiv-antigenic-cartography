# Antigenic cartography of HIV using Bayesian multidimensional scaling.

This is a repository of data and analyses used to conduct antigenic mapping of HIV using data from neutralization assays. These analyses were done more than 10 years ago, and hence may show their age, but are provided here as-is for reproducibility purposes. Analyses were performed in R, with the Bayesian MDS performed using JAGS. Data are publicly available, and references to the original papers can be found in the poster in the (`poster/` directory). There is also an implementation of Bayesian PCA used for comparison.
